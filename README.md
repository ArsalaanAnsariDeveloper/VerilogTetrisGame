# VerilogTetrisGame
I implemented this tetris game in SystemVerilog myself. The project was fairly difficult and needed to be implemented in a very precise way. After writing and rewriting the code several times, I eventually figured it out. A VGA monitor was used to display the game, a mouse was used to control movements, and a speaker was used and interfaced with the FPGA to play a tetris theme song remix. I did not include any of the driver files for the mouse and speaker.
