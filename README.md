# Tetris Game in SystemVerilog
I implemented this Tetris game in SystemVerilog using a DE1-SoC FPGA board. A VGA monitor was used to display the game, a PS/2 mouse was used to control movements, and a speaker was interfaced with the FPGA using an audio CODEC driver to play a tetris theme song remix. I did not include any of the driver files for the mouse and speaker.
