# Tetris Game in SystemVerilog
I implemented this tetris game in SystemVerilog myself using a DE1-SoC FPGA board. The project was fairly difficult and needed to be implemented in a very precise way. After writing and rewriting the code several times, I eventually figured it out and created a robust and clean game of tetris. A VGA monitor was used to display the game, a mouse was used to control movements, and a speaker was interfaced with the FPGA to play a tetris theme song remix. I did not include any of the driver files for the mouse and speaker. There were definitely several parts of this game that I could have done better or more efficiently, but I was in a time crunch and had other difficult classes to deal with on top of this. I worked extremely hard on this project and am very proud of it.
