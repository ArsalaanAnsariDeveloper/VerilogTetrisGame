# Tetris Game in SystemVerilog
I implemented this Tetris game in SystemVerilog using a DE1-SoC FPGA board. A VGA monitor was used to display the game, a PS/2 mouse was used to control movements, and a speaker was interfaced with the FPGA using an audio CODEC driver to play a tetris theme song remix. I did not include any of the driver files for the mouse and speaker. There were definitely several parts of this game that I could have done better or more efficiently, but I was taking two other EE courses at the time. I worked extremely hard on this project and am very proud of it.
